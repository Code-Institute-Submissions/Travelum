#### Bugs
1. __Markers__
    - Did not show info window with content, when clicking.
    - Solution: Added a event.addListener with a function.

    ``` javascript
    	google.maps.event.addListener(
	            marker,
	            "click",
	            (function (marker, i) {
	                return function () {
	                    infowindow.setContent(locations[i][0]);
	                    infowindow.open(map, marker);
	                };
	            })(marker, i)
	        );
	    }
    ```

2. __Drop Markers__
    - Markers did not drop when loading landing page.
    - Solution: Figured out how the iteration with the for loop worked.
    ```  javascript
    let marker, i;
    for (i = 0; i < locations.length; i++) {
        marker = new google.maps.Marker({
            position: new google.maps.LatLng(locations[i][1], locations[i][2]),
            map: map,
            // Creates a drop marker for each destination, when loading or refreshing page 
            animation: google.maps.Animation.DROP,
            // Shows title of destinations when having cursor over marker
            title: markerTitle[i][0]
        });
    ```

3. __One marker responsive__
    - Only New York marker worked as intended.
    - All markers suppose to load images of the destination, when clicking on the link, in the info window.
    - Tried many different ways, many hours of googling and Youtube-videos to learn and find the solution.
    - I was no able to solve the problem and making the different coding approaches to work. 
    - At the end closing in on the deadline on the project, I chose to connect the links/destinations to .html files instead.
    ``` javascript
    function displayDestination() {
        let myLocation = document.getElementById("myCountry");
        if (myLocation.style.display === "none") {
          myLocation.style.display = "block";
        } else {
          myLocation.style.display = "none";
        }
      } 
      
      <a href="javascript:;" onclick="displayDestination()">New York</a><br>
      
      ```
      ``` HTML
      	<section class="container-fluid text-center" id="myCountry">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12">
            <!-- page headline -->
				<h1 class="video-gallery-headline text-center">NEW YORK</h1>
				<img class="flag-icon" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/197/197484.svg" >
			</div>
            <!-- videos gallery -->
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
					<h2>LANDMARKS <i class="fa fa-binoculars" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2>
					<iframe class="videos-gallery" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QM0tipFQ9c"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
					<h2>ACTIVITIES <i class="fa fa-bicycle" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2>
					<iframe class="videos-gallery" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JJfWnAryrM"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
					<h2>FOOD <i class="fa fa-cutlery" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2>
					<iframe class="videos-gallery" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvPqrwGDgnM"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
			</div>
	</section>

4. __Contact alignment__
    - Did not align to the right. Kept to the left next to brand logo.
    - Solution: added Bootstrap “mr-auto” class.
    ``` HTML
    	<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md bg-dark navbar-dark fixed-top">
			<a class="navbar-brand mr-auto" href="index.html"></a>
			<div class="navbar-nav">
				<span class="nav-item active">
						<a class="nav-link" href="contact.html" aria-hidden="true">Contact</a>
                        </span>
			</div>
		</nav>
    ```

5. __Form/E-mail__
    - Did not work when testing to “Send”.
    - Solution: Added “response” and “error” as parameters to functions.

    ``` javascript
                function (response) {
                console.log("SUCCESS", response);
            },
            // Confirms in the console if submit was unsuccesful
            function (error) {
                console.log("FAILED", error)
            })
    // blocks loading a new page
    return false;
}
    ```

6. __Fontawesome icons__
    - Some of the Icons from Font Awesome did not work as intended. 
    - Realized that the icons were from different versions of Font Awesome. 
    - Solution: find all icons that was responsive for the applied Font Awesome CDN version. 

7. __Google Maps API__
    - API did not load and was not working.
    - Realized that there are different API keys for different maps.
    - Soultuion: Found the correct API key that worked for the chosen map.

8. __Loading map laging__
    - Map was lagging when loading page.
    - Had the “script src” at the top.
    - Solution: erased async/defer and put the “script src” at the bottom.

9. __maps-js file__
    - Started to work on this file, with searchbox and markers.
    - Got stuck on this project and could not find the solution, to make intended markers appear with the searchbox.
    - Started instead with main.js file. 
    - Was doing A/B testing and it worked better with B, which was the main.js file. 
    - To be clear, A which was maps.js was cancelled, in favor of main.js.
    - Here is a link to the project with the file: [maps.js](https://github.com/Sebastian-Torres-Matrix/Travelum/blob/master/assets/js/maps.js)

10. __Wireframes__
    - Project and wireframes are not fully synced.
    - Was not able to figure out, how to make .html files load through Javascript, when clicking on marker. 

11. __Responsive Design__
    - Responsive design was not working on all devices.
    - Responsive design shows different in different devices on the same breakpoints.
    - Solution: Added media queries in css and through testing in DevTools.
