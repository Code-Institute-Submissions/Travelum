    - Tried many different ways, many hours of googling and Youtube-videos to learn and find the solution.
    - I was no able to solve the problem and making the different coding approaches to work. 
    - At the end closing in on the deadline on the project, I chose to connect the links/destinations to .html files instead.
    ``` 
    function displayDestination() {
        let myLocation = document.getElementById("myCountry");
        if (myLocation.style.display === "none") {
          myLocation.style.display = "block";
        } else {
          myLocation.style.display = "none";
        }
      } 
      
      <a href="javascript:;" onclick="displayDestination()">New York</a><br>
      
      ```
      ``` 
      	<section class="container-fluid text-center" id="myCountry">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-12">
            <!-- page headline -->
				<h1 class="video-gallery-headline text-center">NEW YORK</h1>
				<img class="flag-icon" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/197/197484.svg" >
			</div>
            <!-- videos gallery -->
				<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4">
					<h2>LANDMARKS <i class="fa fa-binoculars" aria-hidden="true"></i></h2>
					<iframe class="videos-gallery" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QM0tipFQ9c"

					<iframe class="videos-gallery" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvPqrwGDgnM"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
			</div>
	</section>

4. __Contact alignment__

    - Solution: added BootsTap “mr-auto” class.
